Code for practice, that asks for the search term to the user, searches for the term in both <b>indeed.com</b> and <b>weworkremotely.com</b>, and writes the result in a CSV file.
It only searches up to 5 pages in Indeed.com to prevent too many requests, since this is just a practice.

In the VSCode terminal, enter
<code>pip install beautifulsoup4 requests selenium</code>
before running this test code.
